         blurb: "Are you crazy about matcha? Always craving that bitter-sweet, deep tea-flavoured, calming green stuff? Well then you're gonna want to try out these three fabulous spots in Tokyo for matcha sweets. Fortunately, they're all within the metropolitan area along the <i>green</i> JR Yamanote Line, so you won't be needing to transfer. Hooray!",
         text: "<br><b>Mihashi, Ueno Main Store みはし上野本店</b><br><br><img src=\"../img/kanto-matcha-1.JPG\"><br>Located quite close to JR Ueno Station, and right next to Yokoame Market, Mihashi is a cozy little shop with wooden interior decoration giving off a modern, yet authentic, feel to it. They specialise in <i>anmitsu</i> which is agar jelly with syrup and topped with red bean paste, shiratama dango or other types of mochi, fruit, and/or ice cream. Mihashi usually uses matcha ice cream, but I took advantage of their summer deal and got a <i>houjicha</i> (roasted green tea) dish, as seen in the photo. They also sell matcha drinks and <i>kakigori</i> (shaved ice). Overall, the presentation is quite basic, but each individual component of the anmitsu is high quality. A strong tea flavour from the smooth and creamy ice cream, the red bean paste wasn't dry, some actual red beans were mixed in, mochi was soft and chewy, agar jelly was firm but spongy, and the orange slices added a citric and contrasting sour element to heighten the sweetness of the dish. At the low price of around 600 yen for any dessert, this is something you can even savour on a daily basis. There usually isn't much of a wait, and there are a few other stores in Tokyo, so there's no reason not to try Mihashi out!<br><br><b>Saryo Tsujiri 茶寮都路里</b><br><br><img src=\"../img/kanto-matcha-6.JPG\"><br>Hidden away in a corner on the 10th floor of Daimaru above Tokyo Station, Saryo Tsujiri is one of the most hyped cafes to get your kick of matcha for the day. At an odd afternoon period of 4pm, I arrived to find a 1.5 hour queue time. Waiting in line were many local Japanese people, with some foreigners mixed in. I noticed the couple in front were visitors from Hong Kong who followed a foodie magazine here, hyping up the experience even more. After a gruelling amount of wait-time, I was permitted into the cafe which was surprisingly spacious once you're pass the traditional Japanese curtains at the entrance. Again, the interior design is mostly wooden, but this time with much brighter lighting to lighten up the mood. There's a great view by the window too!<br><br><img src=\"../img/kanto-matcha-2.jpg\"><br>First I ordered their signature parfait (tokusen tsujiri pafe 特選都路里パフェ), the most expensive option. The accompanying photo for this post, at the top, shows the layout of my table at this point. Pretty minimalistic but beautiful. The parfait glass was also notably large. Maybe not as large as I made it out to be though, haha!<br><br><img src=\"../img/kanto-matcha-4.JPG\"><br>The parfait started with some matcha mousse at the top, then transitioned to some blocks of matcha castella cake, matcha ice cream, matcha jelly, red bean paste, shiratama dango, other dango balls made from red bean, some sweet potato, and finally agar jelly at the bottom. The presentation was beautiful, and the sweets were very flavoursome. I couldn't believe how many things were made of matcha! Probably the best matcha dessert I've ever had, but it was at a steep price of around 1,900 yen.<br><br><img src=\"../img/kanto-matcha-5.jpg\"><br>Since I took the liberty of coming all the way to Saryo Tsujiri, I also ordered their Gion Shigure 祇園しぐれ matcha iced tea, priced at around 900 yen. It was not too sweet, and had a good emphasis on the green tea. It also came with a small Japanese manju sweet.<br><br>I would probably say Saryo Tsujiri is a must-try shop for matcha parfait lovers, but the wait can be quite long. It's also on the expensive side, so maybe just drop by here if you have spare time and money.<br><br><b>Nanaya Aoyama ななや青山店</b><br><br><img src=\"../img/kanto-matcha-8.JPG\"><br>Nanaya is one of the ice cream shops in Tokyo dishing out concentrated doses of matcha from level 1 to 7. Another store doing this is Suzukien in Asakusa, which I have yet to visit. Originally from Shizuoka Prefecture, which is known for producing green tea, they brought a store to Shibuya in Tokyo.<br><br><img src=\"../img/kanto-matcha-9.JPG\"><br><img src=\"../img/kanto-matcha-10.JPG\"><br>They have a wide variety of ice cream flavours. As you can see, the several levels of matcha are their main selling point and displayed right at the front. But they also have other flavours like houjicha, strawberry, mango, and even matcha-lemon! All the matcha flavours are also available in small cup-sized packaging to take home and store for enjoying on another hot summers day. Or any day, really.<br><br><img src=\"../img/kanto-matcha-7.JPG\"><br>For eating at the store, they provide a sleek black plastic cup which is thick enough that it seems like a waste for single-use. The pricing is also a bit strange as it seems like a single serving costs 400 yen (matcha level 7 costs more than other flavours), and a \"double\" is just two flavours in the same sized cup, but costs 650 yen. You'd think they give you two scoops based on how other ice cream shops work, but I guess not. Optionally, you could buy two single servings to get more ice cream for slightly more money. I got a double with matcha level 4 and 7. The former was decently strong in matcha flavour already, and the level 7 was a bit more bitter and rich in mellow tea flavour. But the levels don't go up as much as I'd hoped. Going along with this scale, I would've enjoyed something around the level 12 mark.<br><br>That concludes my insights into these three top-notch places for matcha desserts in Tokyo. Nanaya is actually around the Omotesando area, which is filled with trendy shops. There's another place called Chachanoma in Omotesando which is also on my list of places to go. Maybe you can even check it out yourself!"

You just need to be a native English speaker, right? WRONG! Here are five skills they regrettably didn't inform you about during the interview. If you want to be successful in your new job, then you'd better get yourself ready!",
         text: "<br><b>5. Multi-tasking</b><br>Teachers don't have time to waste in class. Efficiency is crucial. You've only got 50 minutes to go through some new vocabulary, a bit of reading, speaking practice, and ten different \"games\"! One way to smooth out the transition between activities is to multi-task. One tried-and-tested method, by yours' truly, is to write example sentences on the board while explaining the task or grammar point to the students, all while planning how to pipeline each activity in your head. If you can't process three different chains of thought simultaneously, you might have a tough time as an ALT. Being able to write different sentences simultaneously with both hands is a bonus. Same goes for juggling some chalk with your feet.<br><br><b>4. Proactive Employee</b><br>Usually, proactive workers are valuable because they go above and beyond their expected roles and overachieve by taking on extra workload. But in this case, ALT's have so much down-time during exam periods, school holidays, or even between classes, that you'll probably go insane if you just sit at your desk twiddling your thumbs. Thus, it's in your best interest to be an expert in the art of making yourself busy. Study education concepts or the Japanese language. Start an English Board somewhere at school, or prepare some fun materials for games during class. Read some news and catch up on everything happening outside of Japan. Or maybe even just go out to the school field and join a P.E. class or run some laps. Without this skill, you're going to lose your <i>genki</i> very soon...<br><br><b>3. Become the English Avatar</b><br>British. American. Australian. Canadian. To succeed, you must master the four types of English used in each country. And every other country, really. Your colleagues will come asking you obscure questions such as where the term \"happy shower\" is used, to which you'll probably be thinking it isn't a real term. But there's still a chance it's used in some state in some country you've never heard of before. Your job is to know all these random facts.<br><br><b>2. Entertainment Connoisseur</b><br>Everyone knows you need to establish some common ground in order to build rapport with new acquaintances, including your students. In this case, you just need to know every anime character within the last 20 years, all the mascots for regional and corporate entities, the top J-Pop artists, currently airing TV dramas, and the YouTuber Hikakin. In particular, memorise the names and faces of the members in K-Pop sensations TWICE and BTS. Sounds easy, right?<br><br><b>1. Literally Every Other Skill You Can Think Of</b><br>Speaking of rapport, you'll want to join the school clubs in Junior or Senior High School. That means you need to be an expert in every sport, especially baseball, and really show off your technical genius in academic communities such as chemistry club or math society. You'll also want to crush a few students with your 9th Dan <i>Shogi</i> skills. Bonus points for speaking fluently in several other languages, having a huge Instagram following, and being a professional Player's Unknown Battleground gamer.<br><br>Equip yourself with these five skills and you'll be rewarded with an unforgettably awesome experience as a teacher in Japan. You can even brag about how qualified you are at the pre-departure and Tokyo orientations! That'll certainly put those unprepared second-grade weeboo teachers to shame!"

         blurb: "Everybody likes some down-time once in a while. You might be thinking kicking back on the couch with a beer in hand, getting a solid session of gaming in with your friends, or even just reading a book while sipping on some tea or coffee. But how exactly does this fit in with rest as a Christian?",
         text: "Recently I came across a particular excerpt while practicing Japanese reading. It mentioned that businessmen go out to cafes or restaurants to chat, smoke and have some tea during work hours. It also noted that long business meetings usually have short intermissions and light refreshments to get you through the ordeal. The point it was making is that rest isn't about slacking off, but a necessity to recuperate and work productively. <b>Rest is a part of work.</b> And this is quite a bold statement in Japan, where many deaths have occurred simply from overwork, and that's before even counting the cases related to stress from overwork. People are constantly doing work, either to get that promotion, or because their boss or working environment demands that they produce more results. Does this sound familiar to you? For students, you might see this overwork in the form of studying every day and working part-time when you're not.<br><br>Another case brought up by one of my friends is that people are just absurdly busy even outside of work. Friday night drinks, parties, weddings, sending your kids to football practice, there's a lot to consider in your social and family life. And let's not get started on household chores. Personally, FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) has really ruined much of my rest time over the last 5 years, but I'm starting to realise how destructive it is. If you've also experienced this endless need to be invited to every event and hang out with everyone you know, know that this is completely meaningless. You don't want to be like the people in John 12:43 who \"loved the glory that comes from man more than the glory that comes from God\". And how do you share in the glory that comes from God? By believing in Jesus Christ as Son of God and your saviour, and being filled with a love like that of God (John 17:20-26). This love is good, selfless, forgiving (1 Corinthians 13:4-8) and should bring saving grace (John 3:16).<br><br>So we see there are people who work too much, and people who put too much into their schedule. I think most of us in the 21st Century fit in one of these categories. We always need to keep busy. That's what the world tells us. Stopping for a moment means we've lost an opportunity. But we should really be looking to God for guidance, not the world. And all the way back in Genesis 2:2, we already see God bringing forward this concept of rest after work. Even in Exodus 20:8-11, we're told to rest as God did after the creation of the world. This day of rest can be seen as both a commandment and sign of our trusting relationship with God (Ezekiel 20:12), but also exists because God gives us what is good. If we spend all our time labouring for work or for our friends and family, are we well rested enough to do our work or interact with people in a manner glorifying God? Do we even have any time for God? Do we remember His greatness? Do we confide in Him through prayer?<br><br>Paul tells us in Romans 4:5 that \"the one who does not work\" has his or her \"faith counted as righteousness\". He's not saying no one should work. Instead, he's emphasising the idea that God has already done everything necessary for you to attain salvation (Ephesians 2:8-9), and that is through Christ. Your work does nothing to affect that, including any ministry work. The story of Martha and Mary in Luke 10:38-42 shows it's important to spend time listening to God's word, not just doing things to serve Him.<br><br>What happens if we don't rest? Well when you don't get enough sleep, you become grouchy and irritated easily, and you can't focus because you're mentally and physically tired, and falling asleep. This is not the state we want to be in while living out our lives for God. But what's worse is what I like to call <i>spiritual burnout</i> from too much focus on doing things for God and not enough spiritual nourishment from the Bible. I'm a real '<i>yes man</i>'. I like to serve God in whatever way I can. But as ministries piled up, I just went week in-week out planning, preparing and <i>doing</i> things. I no longer served God but just did things for the sake of getting them done. And with anything where your reason and motivation for doing it is gone, your work ethic drops and you start dreading it. Think of mowing the lawn or cleaning your home. You just gotta do it, right? Labouring for the Lord without setting aside time to reflect can be self-destructive.<br><br>God wants us to rest. He wants us to sleep well. He wants us to be ready to labour well for His sake. He wants us to read His words in the Bible. He wants to talk to us in prayer. And He wants us to have some time to watch movies, play games, talk with friends and just <i>chill</i>. Are you willing to stop checking your e-mails, put down your phone, cancel those five parties and two business meetings scheduled next weekend, and just stop being busy?<br><br><i>Written on a nice and relaxing Sunday afternoon.</i>"

This seems to be attributed to the general Japanese mentality of not being a nuisance to those around them, and also to be a part of a unanimous collective. But there's something even more surprising about this country's reception of music which affects the concert crowds to a larger extent...",
         text: "At the end of March, I went to my very first ONE OK ROCK concert. I'd bought a heap of pre-sale band merchandise online, and even more at the concert venue in Osaka for designs which were sold out online. Since fans often listen to their music on YouTube, Spotify or Apple Music, the main form of support for their favourite artists seems to be in attending live concerts and purchasing merchandise, rather than CD's. Although, Japan is still one of the few countries which seem to still make a lot of physical CD sales. It seems like tour performances usually don't have ridiculous lines for the merchandise, but the summer music festivals are definitely a blood bath with lines stretching up to 2 hours long.<br><br>As the rock concert kicked off, something was very off. Pretty much no one was screaming out their lungs. It seems that the audience only sings a few lines in the pre-chorus or chorus. The rest of the song can be summarised in one word: chanting. Maybe you've seen Japanese pop idol concerts on TV or YouTube. The audience wave their glowsticks. That's basically what every Japanese concert is like, including rock concerts. There are only four actions you need to learn to become a professional concert-attendee in Japan. First, the most commonly used action is to raise one arm and hit the air, like banging on a door. You must accompany this action with a loud <i>\"oi\"</i>. The second action is just clapping. The third is to hold out your hand, reaching for the stars, which is used for long extended notes. Finally, the fourth action is to rock your head back and forth like a headbang, but this action is exclusively used for half-time beats. Earlier I said the crowds are less energetic, but maybe it's just that they channel all their energy into these actions, which is a weaker presence than the screaming, dancing and moshing in Western countries. Either way, we see a very organised approach to audience interaction. Everyone is packed like sardines, but as long as you follow these four actions simultaneously with the rest of the crowd, you won't be bumping heads and causing trouble for anyone.<br><br>Next is the real bane of the music scene in Japan. At the ONE OK ROCK concert, most people knew the songs from their 2017 Ambitions album, but there was undeniably a thirst for some older favourites in the crowd, which is fair because they probably prefer Japanese songs over ones written mostly in English. However, my other recent visits to concerts for Silent Siren and Yanagi Nagi revealed that many fans had <b>not</b> heard songs released within the last few months. This means they had no idea about some songs on the playlist during the concert. These periods when the audience is quite quiet make it awkward for the artists performing passionately on stage.<br><br>So what are the fans listening to these days? My guess is that they're usually pre-occupied with other mainstream music. \"Liking\" music is very superficial in Japan. Everyone only knows the mainstream groups appearing on media, and because of the group social mentality, they often follow the same artists as their friends or colleagues. This leads to both a fanbase lacking in spirit, and a shallow music industry where a few artists dominate the scene. However, the silver lining is that Japanese music labels contract a lot of young talent, so even if you don't become famous with 100 million followers, it's much easier to have corporate backing and land your break through a widely marketed debut single, or appearance in drama and anime.<br><br>The ONE OK ROCK concert crowd wasn't what I expected, but nonetheless I achieved my dream of attending one of their concerts. I was tearing up a bit during their last song, <i>We Are</i>, because it marked the end of this 6 year long goal of mine, and the song is filled with the band's passion to continue forward making the music they love. I can't wait to see what they have in store for us later this year, seeing as they're already in the midst of creating a new album, and have plenty of time after this weekend's Fukuoka Dome performances..."

Crab, Kobe beef, takoyaki, even some melon bread. I thought I'd also try the acclaimed Pablo cheese tarts, but when I was approaching the store front, I noticed something strange. No more than two hundred metres away from me was Glico Man. I knew something was up, so I bolted out of there. I didn't stop to think. My instincts told me to get out of there as soon as possible. I ran back to Namba, took the subway to Nipponbashi and got off there to continue my adventure in Osaka. I followed the shops along the street for a good hour or so. There were some cool Japanese sweets and souvenirs for sale, so I was quite immersed in what the shops had to offer. But then I looked around me, and to my horror, I'd magically been transported back to the streets of Dotonbori. Glico Man was just across the river, mocking me with his arms poised up and cheery smile. It was just like a scene from the Matrix, a dimension I was trapped in. A labyrinth of delicious food and glowing neon signs.\"<br><br>Mr. Ng refused to guide us through the route he took yesterday when we enquired.<br><br>\"I'd sooner be sent to the shadow realm than return to that hellish nightmare of a place.\""

For foreigners, being late fifteen minutes might be proper, and being on time is early. But in Japan, being on time means five minutes early, and being ready for an interview means being there thirty minutes before. In this case, a punctual train leaves right on time, down to the millisecond. We're already being generous by letting the trains run half a second late without any compensation. If I missed my train, having to wait three minutes for the next service could mean being at work on time, which is late. I could lose my job! That's why the shinkansen conductors must offer an apology if the service runs a minute late. I'm sure many people have their lives ruined due to an incapable train conductor who can't get the time right.\"<br><br>Mr. Nguyen boasted that he arrives at work about a minute before his contracted hours start, being both early and close to being on time. Ironically, that means he is both late and unpunctual by the previous definitions of punctuality.<br><br>We tried to include comments regarding transport punctuality from our reporters in New York, London and Sydney, but they couldn't make the interviews due to massive delays on public transport. We managed to secure an insightful comment from our contact in Shanghai, though. \"因为鬼佬是懒惰阿!\""

The McDonald's Loose Change Menu ushered in a new era of solace, but these survival tips in Japan are on an entirely different level.",
         text: "<br><b>1. Fast Food</b><br>Everyone knows about McDonald's, KFC, Burger King, and Pizza Hut. But quite frankly, those chains are reserved for days when you're just craving for Western food and don't mind forking out a bit more than you should be for such inferior products. Instead, how about Mos Burger for something a bit different? Coco Curry also offers large servings of Japanese curry for affordable prices. And who could forget my favourite places for a quick fix of <i>gyudon</i>, or beef bowl, at Sukiya and Yoshinoya. Those mega sized meals will satisfy even the biggest eaters for a measly 700 yen.<br><br><b>2. <i>Onigiri</i> (Rice Ball)</b><br>Never underestimate the power of the rice balls. Thanks to convenience stores being pretty much <b>everywhere</b> in Japan, it isn't too difficult to drop by and pick up a few rice balls at around 100 yen each. Usually, three is enough. But you're always welcome to stuff your face with four or five, or ten.<br><br><b>3. <i>Obentou</i> (Lunch Box)</b><br>Another favourite offered in convenience stores and train station <i>obentou</i> shops. There are a huge variety of meals ranging from plain noodles to deep-fried meat or fish on rice. Furthermore, they're also packaged beautifully! Prices are typically around 500 yen, but something more luxurious, such as <i>unagi</i> in a high quality decorated wooden box, might be as high as 3000 yen! These lunch boxes can usually be reheated in a microwave on purchase, so take advantage of that for a piping hot meal on the go.<br><br><b>4. Instant Meals</b><br>Frozen meals or instant ramen, stocking up on these types of things will allow you to save both money, and time since you don't need to journey out into the wilderness. There's no faster meal than one at home at the push of a button. There are a great number of choices regarding flavour and serving sizes, so buy as your heart (and stomach) takes you! I usually go with 300g of pasta or a jumbo bowl of ramen, which is surprisingly only around 150-200 yen.<br><br><b>5. Banana and Yoghurt</b><br>The only reasonably priced fruit in Japan is the banana. In fact, it's pretty cheap at 100-200 yen a bunch! Coupled with yoghurt at 100 yen for 3 servings, you can whip up a quick and healthy breakfast instantly for no more than 100 yen!<br><br><b>6. Supermarkets and Department Stores</b><br>Foreigners often don't realise that supermarkets AND department stores offer massive discounts on perishable foods at the end of the day. Finishing work late and feeling famished? Pop in to your local supermarket for everything on half the original price! I'm talking sushi, dumplings, pizza, fried chicken, and even sweets (both the Western and Japanese kinds)! You could get a bit of everything for under 1,000 yen, or just your favourites for a couple hundred. For those wanting something packaged nicely, the department store basement floor has that covered, at a slightly higher cost.<br><br><b>7. Cabbage</b><br>I got this idea from a TV show where a celebrity explained she often just eats cabbage. Personally, I haven't tried this, but this is for all you salad-loving vegans out there. Get a discounted cabbage from your local supermarket for 50 yen and eat it over the course of four meals. You just put that gluttonous African child living on 200 yen a day to shame!<br><br>Not only are these options helpful for budgeting, but they still offer you large serving sizes and countless choices for whatever you're craving that day. Who said Japanese food was expensive?"

In previous years, award recipients had accumulated up to 1,193 hours of sleep, more than a quarter of their working hours.<br><br>When asked about the reason for such a system, Mr. Nakamura replied, \"There's no better indicator of dedication to quality than an employee who's worked to the point of falling asleep in the office.

As a new employee in the communications division, I always had time to spare after making my rounds ensuring the department staff had clear channels to communicate with partnering companies. It wasn't looking good. But then I decided to pick up reading Boys Lov- I mean informative articles, and soon found myself <i>busy</i> until four in the morning every day. Subsequently, my hours dozing off at work steadily increased. I highly recommend aspiring award winners put in that <i>extra effort</i>.

Keep in mind that any \"overtime\" doesn't include Saturdays, which are normal working hours for most Japanese. This excessive amount of work is attributed to a variety of factors. Lower hourly wages than their Western counterparts, aspirations to climb the corporate ladder, and simply because Japanese society taught them to always be working as hard as possible. The repercussions of this working culture include high suicide rates, physical and mental health issues, and a lack of time for friends and family.<br><br>While they keep themselves tidy and respectful at work, we see a different side once they leave the office. If you happen to know a Japanese person, chances are they love a good night out with some drinks. Japanese have a drinking culture, and you'll definitely see hordes of salarymen lined up at bars, <i>izakaya</i> (those pubs with big Japanese letters written on banners and lanterns) and <i>kushiyaki</i> (grilled kebab skewers) joints in Japan during after-work hours, so 7pm-4am. You might think they just all enjoy a cold beer after a long day, but it's so much more than that! This is the time when they can speak to colleagues about their personal lives or complain about work. All those Japanese tendencies to maintain a perfect image by being polite and refined went straight out the window when they walked through those <i>noren</i> curtains marked <i>\"yakitori\"</i>.<br><br>Although they're busy bad-mouthing that annoying client or colleague, a level of respect for colleagues present at the venue is still maintained. This is seen through the unspoken rule of pouring drinks for others. This time is to build on workplace relationships, not just to satisfy their love of Kirin Ichiban. Never forget that Japanese society's foundation is that community and harmony is much more important than the individual. Sometimes this can backfire though, as colleagues continue to order more beverages for you, thus increasing your bill and your odds of waking up in an unknown location.<br><br>The strangest aspect of this drinking culture is the ability of Japanese people to wake up for work the next day without looking like a zombie. It seemingly has zero negative impact on their daily lives!

         text: "For my Aussie friends, here's a quick link to the <b>Australian</b> <a href=\"http://www.au.emb-japan.go.jp/itpr_en/education_jet_en.html\" target=\"_blank\">application page</a>. No need to thank me. The link usually stays the same every year, so don't fret if you're reading this in subsequent years.<br><br>If you're not familiar with the JET Programme, you can read about the details over on my <a href=\"https://thechristimes.herokuapp.com/jet\">JET page</a>. Due to the appeal of such a job, there is undoubtedly a large number of applicants. Fortunately, there are many positions available, and approximately a quarter of applicants will receive an offer (for Australia, America and Canada). This means you don't need to be that perfect candidate with fluent English and Japanese, every kind of teaching qualification and 5 years teaching experience. Instead, you just need to be the top 25\% of your cohort, or at least <i>appear</i> to be.<br><br>In order to show off your compatibility with the JET Programme, or keep up the facade that you are, you'll need to firstly show that you can follow instructions. Write down a memo to double- no, <b>TRIPLE</b>-check your application forms are filled in correctly and ordered in the specified format. Any mistake could cost you the job! The checklist compiles most of the common problems in one succinct document. There's a chance the administrator checking applications will happily accept some forms stapled in the wrong order, but I wouldn't risk it after spending all those gruelling hours filling in forms and hundreds of dollars on official photos, documents, and health and police checks. They've got hundreds or thousands of applications to sort through, they don't want to be that loving mother who tidies up all the mistakes applicants have made.<br><br>The next pro tip is to apply for your official academic transcript, proof of university graduation and proof of nationality early in the process. These things take time (and money)! You can rush an authorisation form, but you can't get a passport within half a day (actually, I've heard it's possible, but you don't want to be in this stressful situation). After you have all these documents, you can make copies and take them to the appropriate person for certification. No need to make multiple trips!<br><br>Third tip, make sure you ask for references early. Tell your referees what skills the JET Programme requires, so they can focus their letter on what make's you awesome! If you're not happy with the initial letter, you could ask the referee to re-write a section. In the case that one of your referees forgets about the letter, like one of mine, you have ample time to chase them up if they don't hand you a letter within a week or two. Referees should be people you trust, and people who love what you do. But if your professor or employer doesn't know you too well, that's okay. Just tell them to write about your great marks, can-do attitude, and spirit for cultural exchange. Remember to smile!<br><br>Fourth tip, hand in the best essay you've ever written in your life! The <i>Statement of Purpose</i> is a 1-2 page document for you to outline why you are perfect for the JET Programme. This is definitely the make it or break it part of your application, assuming you've followed all those administrative hassles above. Here, you want to deliver a powerful argument for what you have to offer in working as an <b>ASSISTANT</b> language teacher, as a cultural representative of your country, and what goals you hope to pursue after being enlightened on Japanese culture during your time on the JET Programme. Make sure you address all three of these issues, and that your sentences and paragraphs flow smoothly. Are your points jumping around within the same paragraph? Are you repeating something mentioned earlier? Can you compact a sentence so that it is shorter and more succinct? I recommend asking friends and family to proofread each draft and provide feedback on whether it addresses the three main issues, and reads well.<br><br>Contrary to the size of the tedious application forms, their weighting on your chances of success are probably lower than the <i>Statement of Purpose</i> and reference letters. You just need to fill them out properly. Combined, all those pages provide a good background for administrators to understand how much you value cultural exchange, Japan, and teaching. But it's not going to be detrimental if you haven't got many extracurricular activities or opportunities for cultural exposure to write in those boxes. The interviewers asked me about the countries I've visited. Everything else was related to my essay. Don't stress too much about these bulky application forms!<br><br>If you follow these tips and truly hold a deep interest in Japanese culture or working in Japan, you'll probably make it to the interview stage. Just make sure you don't put a huge emphasis on reading manga and watching anime, there's an unspoken rule that filthy <i>otaku</i> have lower odds of conveying professionalism and openness to the wider Japanese culture. Mention it as the starting point of your interest in Japan, but don't make it your life.<br><br>Good luck to all the applicants this year! I'll write a guide for the dreaded interviews closer to the date (around late January)."

         blurb: "It's been just under 2 weeks since I arrived here in Tokushima. Things are starting to settle down, but I'm certainly not idle. As the University of New South Wales motto goes, \"Never Stand Still\". What I have found very interesting is that summer, the current season, is a time when festivities are held left, right and centre. These events have pre-occupied me, and will continue to do so for another week or two. So, what can you expect from festivals in Japan?",
         text: "Festivals, or <i>matsuri</i>, are celebrated throughout the country. Different regions will celebrate their own unique festivals carried down through generations. However, there are a few periods each year when most prefectures will hold their events. One such period is Obon, a time when spirits of the dead are honoured. This occurs on 15 August, but is surrounded by festivities since the summer season is perfect for shaved ice, water activities, dancing, and enjoying fireworks in the cool rejuvenating night breeze.<br><br>I paid my first visit to Tokushima City's own riverside event two weeks ago. With countless food stalls, souvenir shops and musical performances to boot, it's no wonder that approximately 3,000 people are at the venue at any given moment. I had to park my bike across the road and around another block. Some consistent findings at festivals would be the classic takoyaki, yakisoba and kushiyaki (grilled skewers of vegetables or meat). Since it was a night event, various colourful glowing toys were also available for purchase. The fireworks started at around 8pm, but only one was fired every five seconds or so. Not ideal for fireworks enthusiasts nor photographers. I hightailed it out of there shortly after.<br><br>Next up was a shrine festival just last Friday at Tsushima. The stalls were operating already during the day, with all the favourite munchies and some unfamiliar stall games readily available. Later at night, another fireworks display was scheduled, but it was even worse than the Tokushima City one. Round 2, no dice. These were both very consumer-based festivals. Lots of people, lots of sales. What happens if we put the focus on being a part of the festivities rather than just shopping?<br><br>Third time's the charm, right? Well this ideal certainly didn't fail me! Instead of visiting a festival to get some grub and take some photos, I joined a group participating in the local 'Dragon' festival located in Mitoyo. There was a huge parade of dancing, and a joint effort in carrying a three tonne straw dragon up and down the street. There were still a few food stalls set up, but the emphasis on the local community participating really shines through. Schools, neighbourhood associations, friends and family all joined in. If you weren't in the parade, you were having some good fun splashing bucketloads of water on the poor souls on the street. Everyone wore matching event clothing, and one man even went commando in the midst of the events. I hate trying to get through crowds, but this time we were all walking in the same direction. This is exactly the kind of festivals that I look forward to this year.<br><br>I was planning on returning to the largest fireworks display on the Shikoku island, but the recent level 5 typhoon has ruined it. Next up is the biggest event in Tokushima City, the Awa Odori Festival. The city will be banding together to dance along the downtown streets. Sure, the regular festivals with stalls, games and fireworks might be a great time to hang out in yukata, but there's so much more to an event where the community unites to host activities together. If you're in Japan during the summer period, keep an eye out for local festivities. You don't want to miss out on these rare opportunities to experience what Japan's long history and traditions have to offer!"

What's coming?",

It's quite a big city (population on par with Gold Coast, Australia), but sadly it'll take roughly 3 hours by bus to reach the closest metropolis, Osaka. That means a trip to the Japanese mainland will take up half a day already. Yuck! This is definitely not the time to be visiting those normal tourist-y places, but rather an opportunity to explore the vast region of Shikoku, the main island which Tokushima is a piece of. Mountain roads, elevated bridges connecting islands, dusty old streets in long forgotten villages, there is an incredible amount of cycling fun to be had on Shikoku! Even within Tokushima City, there are festivals and markets bustling with excitement. My list of things to do is essentially inexhaustible.<br><br>How will the everyday life look though? Well work is going to be language teaching at a high school, years 7 through to 11, and possibly 12. Accomodation is sorted at a nearby apartment, all to myself! Cooking is going to be a new concept, but restaurants, or even Seven-Eleven rice balls are always a welcome option. Churches are scarce in Japan (excl. Catholic), but I've had some very nice JET Christians plug me in with some contacts. Everything sounds sorted, but there's actually so much left behind the scenes. Phone and Internet plans, utility bills, bank accounts. Transitioning into a different country and carrying the burdens of responsibility and independence is absolutely insane. To top it off, I can only bring a single checked-baggage of 20kg with me lest I incur the wrath of extra baggage penalties or baggage shipping costs. Honestly, I've decided just to bring resources for work, souvenirs to greet people, and a basic amount of attire to last me the week after arriving in Japan. What better way to keep luggage to a minimum than scrapping anything not absolutely required? If I can buy it in Japan, I don't need to bring it. I've survived in Japan on half a checked-baggage, I can do it again on a third. That is, as long as I bring my debit card to raid Uniqlo and stock up that new wardrobe.<br><br>I don't know how things will turn out until I get there. Who will I meet? What problems are going to pop up on arrival or during work? But those things will sort themselves out. From one of my favourite passages in the Bible, \"...tomorrow will worry about itself\" Matthew 6:34. What's more worrying is my limited time left here in Sydney. I kept telling myself \"I have time, I have plenty of time\", but recently I've wasted so many hours trying to fix up a sudden development of insomnia. I've been hanging out with each of my closest groups of friends every day or two. And yet there's still so much to do and not enough time. Right now I want to tell my future self, don't waste your days over in Japan either. They're going to fly by real fast, and then you're going to regret not being a bigger part of the local community, the school, and more importantly the lives of those people close to you.<br><br>To my friends in Sydney, it's been a pleasure having you guys all these years. Please keep in touch over Facebook, WhatsApp, or even Skype!<br><br><b>Tokushima, I'm coming for you.</b>"

Thoughts fly through your mind. \"What went wrong?\" \"Am I not good enough?\" \"That's alright, there's plenty of fish out there.\" Yes, there are plenty of fish in the ocean, but it might be worth taking a step back to see if your attitude towards dating and expectations of your partner are constructive for future relationships. Here are a few things you should consider.",
         text: "This is the second part in my two-part series on Christian dating. It will outline briefly traps which lovestruck Christians often fall into. <a href=\"https://thechristimes.herokuapp.com/posts/15\">If you missed the first part, you can find it here.</a><br><br>You mustered up that heroic breath of courage and took the leap of faith in confessing your thoughts and feelings. That in itself is already quite a feat, since rejection is a daunting possibility, and no one wants to suffer that enormous weight of failure. There are a million reasons I can give for that person to leave you in a lonely, miserable mess. Unreciprocated feelings, misunderstandings, disinterest in dating. The greatest pitfall is still the two most common reasons I've witnessed among friends: a lack of commitment and devotion of time (or just no time to spend), and the confidence in finding someone better.<br><br>Have a think about yourself first. Are you looking for Prince Charming? Dwayne Johnson, a.k.a. The Rock? Novak Djokovic? Or simply someone who shares the same qualities as you? People grow old, interests shift, and yet a faithful love coming from the hope found in Jesus Christ stays strong through wind and rain. It never fails (1 Corinthians 13:7). Sure, someone who doesn't get frustrated by every word that comes out of your mouth will be much easier to love, but don't let the shallow traits dominate your choice. Personally, I fit at the bottom rung on the ladder of guys to date. I recently read an article explaining characteristics of <i>otaku</i>, or the Japanese equivalent of a geek, and why they don't stand out as dating material in a culture which increasingly places emphasis on anime, manga and games, including some <i>otaku</i> who manage to balance social life and their hobbies (your's truly?). Aspects such as weaker communication skills, a bad sense of fashion, and the tendency to talk about geek entertainment unceasingly. These all contribute to the struggles I face in forming relationships with ANYONE, not just prospective partners. But when I find that cute girl with a big heart for God, a willingness to serve, but the need for a gentle push, I'll work my dating magic faster than you can say, 'Dumbledore'.<br><br>You may have been told by fellow trustworthy Christians to \"pray about it\" before dating, but often we may have our priorities mixed up. Are we praying that we'll complement each other? That God would hook us up? That we will always have joyful times and enjoy the same earthly things? No, this should be something deeper. In the first part of this series, I mentioned that dating is like the trial phase of marriage. Well our prayers before dating (and possibly even during) should be the prequel to that trial. What can I achieve by dating this person? How can we support each other? Does this glorify God? Well even though it's all gone downhill now, there's still much work to do. You should be praying for opportunities to continue supporting this person as a friend and fellow Christian. If we give up on someone because they've hurt us, it's probably best that God decided against this relationship. There's no such thing as a relationship with no conflict.<br><br>Looking forward, where are you headed? Right into another shaky relationship? Taking a break from the troubles of love? Don't be disheartened, my comrade. With man's efforts alone, you'll never be satisfied, but with God, nothing is impossible (Matthew 19:26). He will give you the right person at the right time. Trust Him, the one who made all the heavens and the earth, who is the very embodiment of love. (Matthew 6:33, 1 John 4:8)"

         text: "<b>Disclaimer: I'm not actually dating anyone. I thought this might be good to disclose. Y'know, in case someone was wondering.</b> This was just a good time to reflect on priorities before JET-ing off to Japan. This will be a two-part series on Christian dating. This post will cover how we should approach the concept of dating.<br><br>Someone recently asked me whether I was dating, or had dated a Christian. I laughed it off and denied it, but it got me thinking. \"Why am I not trying to find my <i>soul mate</i>?\" Don't get me wrong, I also look forward to finding this person, just like you. However, there's no reason we need to be enslaved by our desire for <i>the One</i>.<br><br>Jesus set us free from our slavery to sin (Romans 6:18). We know there's merit to resisting our earthly desires now, because there's something better in obedience to God. So why do we still look for that perfect person we've dreamt of, to the point where this desire becomes toxic addiction and a priority above seeking or loving our God with all our heart, soul and mind? There are two parts to that. Firstly, because God made us as humans who work well with a partner, and thus we seek one. Secondly, because we are still susceptible to corruption and selfish desires placing companionship over submission under God. Many people, both Christian and non-Christian, look to dating as an achievement. You've proved your self-worth in having someone accept you for who you are, and you get that fuzzy feeling some people call <i>love</i>. Congratulations! But whether it be relationships or good deeds, we shouldn't be searching for approval from people, but rather God (Galations 1:10).<br><br>If you're grumpy about everything I've mentioned and still want to actively analyse whether someone would make a great date (or not), then here are some guidelines you should consider.<br><br>First and foremost is whether this person loves God. Not only is this healthy for your relationship, but we know that someone who loves God will inherently love His creation - people (1 John 4:20). They'll always put you before themselves. You can be assured that this person isn't riding the wave of hormones, only to dump you when you're boring, annoying and no fun.<br><br>Secondly, this person should be someone you can encourage, and be supported by, in your everyday life and walk with God. It's give and take. There's no reason that either of these responsibilities should be lacking in your relationship. You should be focused on giving, but it's hard to imagine a lifelong partner providing absolutely zero amounts of support in return. If you're in a sticky situation where this is happening, maybe it's time to re-evaluate the relationship.<br><br>As with any (loosely) theological, biblically-based text with structural integrity, the third point is the last point. Short and simple, jump in expecting to be in for the long haul. Dating is basically a trial phase of being married. Marriage is a representation of the complex, yet intimate, relationship between Jesus and the universal Christian church. Go in expecting everything that marriage will encompass.<br><br>For those who aren't really keen on dating right now... You guys <i>might</i> even be the best. Even Paul says so! 1 Corinthians 7 hits it home that those who can stand their ground against burning passion can work with undivided attention for God.<br><br>With all that said, you're ready to choose that rare Pokemon and spend the rest of your life delighting in the ways of the Lord! Or so you thought, but in the end, dating is a two-way road.

Although, some would argue that the chrysanthemum is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Seal_of_Japan\" target=\"_blank\">emperor's seal</a> and should be the national flower. Regardless, it remains true that flower viewing, or <i>hanami</i>, brings flocks of both domestic and international tourists across the nation. The cherry blossom season starts in February, and sweeps across the country going north due to differing climates, and subsequently differing blooming periods. There are only two weeks left until the end of the season, and the remaining regions are Takayama and Kitakami (current), and all the way up to Sapporo (start of May).<br><br>During the season, you'll find the highest traffic in the smallest towns in Japan. This is attributed to the commercialisation of the flower viewing season, such as local festivals in towns and cities, limited seasonal goods, and an influx of media coverage. For Australian university students, the best time to visit Japan would be at the end of summer break, in February just before the semester starts. There are only a handful of blooming locations at this time, and I decided to visit Kawazu in the Shizuoka region.

         text: "Samyang released it's original Spicy Chicken Ramen back in 2016 and many of the poor souls who attempted the instant noodles gave up if they weren't used to eating spicy. Now the new Samyang 2x Spicy \"Nuclear\" Fire Chicken Ramen is out, and has been said to be the spiciest noodles in Korea. I happened upon a pack of these given to me, but you can purchase them online and at local imports stores in Australia, possibly even local Asian grocers. Deciding to try them out and test my tolerance of hot ramen, these are the results...<br><br>The cooking method is simple and similar to instant stir-fry noodles. Boil for roughly 6 minutes, drain (packaging says leave some water inside), add the included sauce, and mix well. My mother was walking pass and decided to sneak in a few strands of those hot-red noodles while I was throwing out the packaging. As someone who can't deal with spicy foods, she was chugging water down for the next minute or so. Although, she did come back for another few strands after, showing how awesome the flavour of the sauce is. Now onto my own experiences with these deathly instant noodles.<br><br>I've been gradually getting used to spicy foods. Starting at Kettle chilli chips and moving to things like Nongshim's Shin Ramyun instant ramen, traditional Chinese spicy offal soup noodles, and Sichuan chilli dishes, I thought I'd stand a decent chance against these fiery noodles. I was wrong. My confidence backfired against me. Taking my cautious first strands of the ramen noodles, I took in the spicy and salty flavours, the bouncy and chewy texture of the noodles and how it compared to other Korean instant ramen like Nongshim or Paldo. First impressions were that it was only a bit spicier than Shin Ramyun, but was easier to handle because there wasn't spicy soup running down my throat and up my sinus stimulating a cough or a sneeze. Devouring a few mouthfuls because of my premature verdict, I got half-way through before the spiciness really kicked in. Most spicy foods don't start burning until your second or third mouthful, but Samyang takes a bit more. Each bite seems to add on to the previous, and it doesn't just cap at some point, it keeps on going! I was struggling to maintain my composure when I was gasping for fresh, cool air to save me from this burning sensation. I'd been aiming to finish the pack without any drinks in one fell swoop, but by now it was unbearable and I had to get a glass of milk. After a sip of milk, I was ready to get back into the game. One small mouthful of the killer noodles and I was taking another sip of milk. Next mouthful? Two sips of milk. By the time I'd finished, I'd gone through 2 glasses of milk, a glass of water, and some apple juice. They all worked momentarily, but by the next bite the inferno in my mouth just came back even hotter than before. \"Nuclear\" is a good description of the rate at which the spiciness levels explode, but 'napalm' is the word I'd use to depict the unquenchable flames punching at my tastebuds. If you thought it was all over, you'd be in for a surprise. My tongue and lips continued to burn for the next 10 minutes or so after I'd sterilised them with milk and water. My head was still burning from the extreme spiciness and sweat dripped from my forehead. But every bite had been worth it. That sauce was the masterpiece Samyang had produced which kept the delicious salty roast chicken flavour while doubling spiciness into the very gates to hell.<br><br>I have to give it to Samyang, they have really made something special. The noodles are some of the best ones I've had, and perfect for chewy noodle lovers. However, it's the sauce which keeps you wanting more even though you can't feel your tongue or lips anymore."

Taking advantage of a recent <a href=\"https://www.groupon.com.au/deals/platia-greek-taverna-1\" target=\"_blank\">Groupon deal for Platia</a>, I had a proper Greek dining experience on Sunday night. This was my very first time visiting a Greek restaurant. I had no idea what they'd serve us because the menu is set by the restaurant depending on available ingredients, but I figured it'd definitely give a taste of various Greek delectables, right?<br><br>Starting off was some pita bread with tamara, tsaziki and tirokafteri (tasted like gherkin, feta cheese and lemon juice). Pretty standard looking Greek starters, I wasn't surprised. The tamara dip was definitely my favourite of the three, with its smooth mix of salted, cured fish roe, olive oil and fresh lemon juice. Next was Greek salad, my worst nemesis, and nothing new. I decided not to eat it. The main course consisted of a huge meat and chips platter. This was what I'd been waiting for all night. Loaded with chicken and lamb souvlaki, sheftalia (onion and parsley-filled sausages), salami, pork belly pancetta, and a bed of crispy golden chips, this was a great sight for an enthusiast of all things meat and chips (fish n' chips, steak n' chips, HSP, you name it). Going through the meats, there were all kinds of textures and meaty flavours to enjoy. I've always been a sucker for souvlaki which is grilled meat on a skewer. Platia had thick, juicy, succuluent pieces of chicken and lamb on the platter, done perfectly. Pork belly pancetta added a familiar taste to the platter, with its tender pork meat and crispy pork skin reminding me of Chinese barbecue pork. The sheftalia turned out to be worse than I expected, with an unusually high ratio of onion and parsley to meat, causing the sausage to be rather crunchy than soft and juicy. The serving was quite large, and by the time I finished the last chip, I was more than happy to sit around in a food coma for the next half an hour chatting.<br><br>What did I learn from this experience? Greek cuisine is everything I expected. Bread, meat, and well the yoghurt was mixed in the tsaziki. Would I go again? I think this is the big question for most European cuisines. They use recipes evolved over the ages, they can taste amazing, they're often very refined and well-presented, but with that luxury comes a hefty price. Just as I'd rather get Domino's pizza over any other Italian restaurant, I wouldn't visit Platia normally with its $50 per person average pricing. I'd stick with my supermarket dips and locally (or home-made) flat bread. I'd consider going just for the wide range of meats available with the platter, for those interested in visiting.<br><br>Note: The Groupon deal has already sold out at time of posting."

         blurb: "A former delinquent and bully, a deaf girl, and the desire to make things right. The premises of the film are highly promising, but did director Naoko Yamada and Kyoto Animation's finest animation artisans deliver?",
         text: "<b>NOTE: THIS CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS</b><br><br>In the lead up to A Silent Voice's western premier, you may have heard that it was the 2016 anime film which was overshadowed by box office record breaker and current top anime (both films and series) Your Name. Seeing as it's currently ranked #14 on MyAnimeList's Top Anime chart, it's no surprise everyone has been looking forward to its premier in other countries. The film hit Sydney cinemas two weeks ago and I took the liberty of organising to visit a screening with some friends. Here are my thoughts on whether the film hit its mark or ricocheted right back.<br><br>As we find out quickly in the film and from all the promotional materials for the film's debut, the basis of the film has Ishida Shouya trying to atone for his past actions of bullying a deaf classmate, Nishimiya Shouko, in elementary school. The opening shots establish the instability Ishida is currently experiencing now in high school. He has given up on making friends because of the 'friends' who betrayed him in the past. He only wishes to repay his family for the trouble he caused as a bully, and selfishly disappear from this world he doesn't belong in. By fate, he bumps into Nishimiya again, and begins his quest of atonement. It's crucial here to understand the point A Silent Voice is making up right from the start. Bullying plagues our society, and as the film later depicts, this plague isn't limited to students, but even adults. Sometimes the bullies feel the repercussions of their actions in guilt, others don't. Here in A Silent Voice we see both, where students who didn't physically bully or did so comparably less than another student would hold a clean conscience and deny participating in these activities. A Silent Voice's stance on bullying is the most powerful message throughout the film and resonates in viewers.<br><br>As the plot unravels, Ishida and Nishimiya continue to understand more about friendship and love. They slowly begin to overcome their struggles and come to face their elementary school classmates and each other head on. Ishida's goal is to reunite them all and create the friendships they never had with Nishimiya. However, as they find out, not everyone is accepting of these ideals. In particular, Ueno never acknowledges a friendship with Nishimiya and instead ridicules her very existence which caused everything to fall apart in elementary school. While this could be interpreted as a continuation of the bullying in the past, or a stubbornness and hatred against Nishimiya even after acknowledging the severity of Ueno's past actions, it serves a greater purpose in Nishimiya's character development. While Ishida and Nishimiya continue to grow closer and rely on each other, Ueno's accusations continue to sink deeper into Nishimiya's mind. She is unable to love herself anymore because of the repercussions of her existence on Ishida and company's lives in elementary school. We watch as the drama of both the protagonist and heroine stretch them to their limits. We laugh with them in their happy times together, we cry for them as they're separated from their friends once again. This film is honestly a rollercoaster ride through every emotion for viewers. The last sprint of the film sees the climax and friendship the main 'couple' have, and what love is capable of.<br><br>Notice how I have been focusing almost entirely on the protagonist and heroine. That is because the director has chosen to remove all back-story from supporting characters during adaption from the manga source, with the exception of what we know from past events in elementary school, and Nishimiya's sister who seems to be the only developed support character. I have been told the manga helps to understand these supporting characters, but from the perspective of someone who simply watched the film, it felt like most of these characters didn't have particular significance. Some appeared once or twice, others throughout the entire duration of the film, but none were properly developed and often the viewer would be confused as to what was happening. For myself, I couldn't help but laugh at the unpredictable and ridiculous actions of these supporting characters. The lack of development here is definitely the bane of A Silent Voice, and what ruined the film for me during the screening.<br><br>Looking at the art style and music, Kyoto Animation has managed to pull off another masterpiece. The art is reminiscient of other Kyoto Animation titles such as K-On! and Tamako Love Story. The background music and sound effects capture the emotions of every scene and deliver it to the audience, heightening the experience and forcing viewers into the shoes of characters. You will notice that Naoko often uses silence or ambient sounds to emphasise character emotions, along with the theme of sign language to communicate through visuals rather than scripted lines. The ending theme, 'Koi wo Shita no wa' sung by aiko, beautifully finishes the tale of adolescent love, friendships and self-worth.<br><br>A Silent Voice is definitely a film with outstanding qualities in most individual aspects. A brilliant blend of deep, real and relatable themes, a protagonist and heroine which strikes us with their development, and brought alive through Naoko's directing and the film's illustrators, animators, sound engineers and musicians. However, I was unable to accept the film for what it is due to the worst support characters in anime film history. By all means watch the film, but expect to be frustrated every time a support character appears on screen."

         blurb: "The Halal Snack Pack (otherwise known as the HSP) is one of Australia's greatest food inventions. Taking off in a crazy hype in 2015, the infamous box of Middle-Eastern cuisine mixed with good ol' chips can now be found in just about every local kebab shop across all major cities. You'll want to know what you're looking for before heading out in search of some 'snackies' though!",
         text: "Finding a kebab shop in Sydney isn't too hard. Sydney CBD, Northern Suburbs, North Shore, Inner West, nearly every suburb has a local Mecca serving you piping hot kebabs now. Are Halal Snack Packs any different?<br><br>It turns out that most joints don't make the cut. Using a variety of measurements, Aussies in the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/HalalSnackPackAppreciationSociety/\" target=\"_blank\">Halal Snack Pack Appreciation Society</a>, the biggest Facebook group and what started this new HSP movement, have managed to rank HSP-serving shops and weed out those who can't keep up with competition. These measurements include the shop owner's greeting, shop display, halal certification, pricing, HSP packaging, meat quality, chips quality, and finally the choice of sauces, with the 'Holy Trinity' (Chilli, BBQ, Garlic) being the standard choice for HSP fans. Highly rated snack packs are referred to as 'halal' snack packs, whereas low-scoring snack packs will be deemed 'haram'. It's not surprising that individuals who choose to eat the worst snack packs, especially those who choose tomato sauce or add salad, are branded as 'haram dingoes'. A list of the best kebab shops across Australia can be found on the HSP Appreciation Society page.<br><br>Today I visited the esteemed Metro One Kebab, Pizza & Pide in Ashfield, Sydney. It'd been half a year since my last snack pack and I'd been keen for another artery-clogging experience of juicy doner kebab meat and freshly fried hot chips. Together with 5 friends, we entered the open store front to be greeted with a 'What can I get for you?' while gazing at the lit up boards and neon signs reassuring us of the halal certified meat. HSP usually come in a variety of sizes where single person servings come in takeaway styrofoam boxes. A regular is enough for your average bloke and costs about AUD$10 in most places. A large is more than what you'd want and sets you back another $3 or so. Additional cheese? Go for it, another dollar or two. We decided instead to tackle the $55 large 15\" pizza box HSP (refer to the photo above) with cheese and mixed meat, approximately the size of four large HSP. It came with a free 1.25L bottle of soft drink. It was the 6 of us versus the equivalent of 4 large HSP, we figured this way we had the option of going home full instead of sprawled on the ground gasping for breath after a deathly amount of meat, chips and sauce. The meat was about the same as most places (saturated and delicious), but the chips were only slightly crunchy. Crunchy chips are what set apart the best HSP from the mediocre ones. For reference, I think the #1 kebab shop nearby in Campbelltown, King Kebab House, is the only place with golden crunchy chips. The top was lathered with the 'Holy Trinity', finishing the masterpiece of a HSP. All in all, it was a fairly good HSP and great value feed, but it just left me craving for the king in Campbelltown.<br><br>Interestingly enough, NSW Senator Sam Dastyari, known for his comical interactions with One Nation Party's founder and leader Pauline Hanson, was filming some footage on food and multiculturalism in Metro One. I definitely didn't let this opportunity slip away and decided to sneak some hilarious poses in, show off my swag and photo-bombing skills. Sam actually came around and interviewed a few of the tables, including us, and I'm waiting eagerly to see the video uploaded online.<br><br>If you're looking for reliable snack packs, I would definitely stop by each of the HSP Appreciation Society recommendations. Although, any nearby kebab shop should suffice if you don't care about soggy chips. Good luck hunting for the best HSP!"

         text: "The Easter bunny and colourful eggs are familiar to all of us, and they're the focus of Easter in the consumer world. Many people understand Easter is somehow related to a man called Jesus, but aren't sure about the specifics. There is indeed a very deep and complex history behind Easter and various reasons for people celebrating Easter today.<br><br>Some evidence suggests that the word 'Easter' might be taken from the German folklore goddess of spring, Eostre, or the German word for Easter, Ostern, which means 'East'. The bunny, or hare, is a symbol of fertility because of their ability to quickly multiply. The egg is a sign of birth and life. These three things don't seem to be related, but were commonly celebrated in spring fertility rituals during the days of the ancient Roman Catholic Church. Christians celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ on the Sunday, and in order to make this celebration more attractive to non-Christians, the Roman Catholic Church decided to adopt Easter as the celebratory day of Christ rising back to life. We see now that Easter's origins have nothing to do with Jesus, but both Christians and non-Christians hold celebrations at the same time of the year!<br><br>Knowing the origins of Easter, should Christians be celebrating Easter? Is it okay to stuff our faces with chocolate? By all means enjoy a bunny (or two), but remember that the true reason that Christians hold celebrations is to express their joy at Jesus Christ' resurrection and the completion of God's plan. Although, this should be on our minds every day, not just during Easter.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.desiringgodchurch.org/web/2009/04/09/why-did-jesus-have-to-die/\" target=\"_blank\">If you are wondering why Jesus needed to die and resurrect, this article explains it in an easily understandable way.</a>"
